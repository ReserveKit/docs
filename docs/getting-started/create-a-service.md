# Create a service

## What is a service?

A service is the main entity for where you will manage your reservations. A
badminton court is a service, a restaurant is a service, a hotel is a service,
etc.

To create a service, you will need to go to the
[ReserveKit Dashboard](https://app.reservekit.com) and click on the "Create a
service" button.

A service gets reservations/bookings, we'll explain more about that in the next
section.
