Welcome to **ReserveKit**, the easiest way to integrate a powerful
booking/reservation backend into your application without having to build your
own server.

ReserveKit is an API backend for your reservation system. It is built by a
frustrated developer who has always been trying to build the perfect reservation
system, everytime.

So, he decided to build an API backend that can be used by others, so you can
focus on building your beautiful reservation UI, without having to worry about
the backend.

## Why Use This API?

- **Zero server maintenance**: We handle all the heavy lifting so you can focus
  on your front-end or mobile app.
- **Scalable**: Whether you have a handful of bookings or millions, our
  infrastructure scales with you.
- **Flexible**: Integrate with your existing systems or use it as a standalone
  booking solution.
- **Secure**: Built with best practices to keep customer data and reservations
  safe.
