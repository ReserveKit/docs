# ReserveKit Documentation

ReserveKit is an API backend for your reservation system. It is built by a
frustrated developer who has always been trying to build the perfect reservation
system, everytime.

So, he decided to build an API backend that can be used by others, so you can
focus on building your beautiful reservation UI, without having to worry about
the backend.

To get started, you will need to create an account with us, so that you can
manage the services you want your end users to reserve.
